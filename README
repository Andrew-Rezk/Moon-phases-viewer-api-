# Moon-phases-viewer-api-
This web app allows the user to input a city and it will inform the user of the viewing conditions, which will help user in deciding if current conditions are ideal to moon gaze. This app uses two apis: The first is the openweathermap api which gets the users viewing conditions and their city name. The second api is VisualCrossingWeather api which gets the current moon phase. I then use this api to output to the webpage the current phase based on moon-phase code (integer between 0-1) and also an image icon of the view of the moon based on the phase which is output.
